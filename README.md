# Dengue Fever Spatial Analysis – Nha Trang City


## 1. Project Overview:
This project applies GIS techniques to explore the spatial distribution of dengue fever cases in Nha Trang City. The focus is on spatial data preparation, exploratory spatial analysis, and density-based visualization using QGIS.

---

## 2. Objectives:
- Map dengue fever case locations using geographic coordinates
- Explore spatial distribution and clustering patterns
- Identify high-risk areas using density-based analysis
- Aggregate dengue cases by ward-level administrative boundaries

  ---

## 3. Data preparation steps:
- From The Commune-Level VietNam map, filter administrative areas belonging to Nha Trang City.
- Export selected features as a separate shapefile.
- Preserve original geometry and attribute structure.


 **_Coordinate Reference System (CRS):_**
- EPSG: 3406 - VN-2000 / UTM Zone 49N

  ---

## 4. Results:
- Spatial distribution map of dengue fever cases in Nha Trang City.
- Heatmap highlighting high-density dengue areas.
- Ward-level aggregation of dengue cases.

---

## 5. Mitigation and Prevention:
Based on the spatial analysis, we recommend the following actions to lower dengue fever risk:
- Concentrate mosquito control in high-risk areas clearly shown on the heatmap.
- Prioritize clean-up and removal of standing water in the wards identified as highest risk.
- Run focused community awareness programs in neighborhoods with high case numbers.
- Implement GIS-driven monitoring for earlier detection and faster response.
